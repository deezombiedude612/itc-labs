# Practical 01: Getting Started with C

This practical will serve as a starting point to getting used to programming in C.
While not a popular language that'll get you far as applications go, it is a very good language for beginners to try out to strengthen their programming skills.

## Getting Started

## Tasks

### Task 1

Write a simple program that will display the following output:

```
Hello, good morning!
I am Miss Yong.
How are you?
```

### Task 2

Write a simple program that will display the following output:

```
     *
    ***

    ***
    ***
```

### Task 3

Write a program that prompts the user to enter their name and then display a greeting like as follows:

```
Enter your name >> Kelly
Hello Kelly!
```

### Task 4

Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer value, a double value, a character and a string.
The program should then proceed to continue the output like as follows:

```
Enter an integer value >> 6
Enter a double value >> 5.5
Enter a character >> A
Enter a string >> Hello

The integer value entered is 6.
The double value entered is 5.5.
The character entered is A.
The string entered is Hello.
```

### Task 5

Write a program that prompts the user to enter two integer values.
The program should then print the sum, difference and product of these two numbers, as well as the quotient and remainder after dividing them.

### Task 6

Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer value.
The program should then print the square root of the integer.

Use the `sqrt()` function from the `math.h` header.
