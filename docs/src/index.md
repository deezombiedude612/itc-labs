**This site hosts optional practical lab work for ITS30505: Introduction to Computing, offered by the School of Pre-University Studies at Taylor's College.**

## Aim

These optional practical lab exercises aim to provide an introduction to programming using the C programming language.
The practical lab exercises do not correlate with the formal lessons conveyed during classes, and can be taken at one's own pace.

This is a small project I plan on slowly completing - in future, I do plan on evolving this website to also contain lab exercises for advanced C programming (including different data structures and algorithms, multithreading, etc.).
